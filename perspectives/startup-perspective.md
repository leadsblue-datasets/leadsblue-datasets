# Startup Perspective on Business Contact Data

Startups often view B2B contact datasets as operational resources that support early-stage outreach and market exploration.

Common startup use cases include:

- initial market testing
- industry targeting
- partnership discovery
- customer discovery research

A company contact list allows startups to reach business segments without building datasets from scratch.

From this perspective, structured data reduces initial research overhead.
